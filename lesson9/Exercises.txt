1. Implement `square(n)` three ways: declaration, expression, arrow.
2. Write `divide(a, b=1)` to return `a/b`, handling missing `b`.
3. Show global vs function scope by declaring `var x = 1;` and inside a function reassigning `x`.
4. Build `makeCounter()` closure that tracks and returns calls count.
5. Call a function before declaration to demonstrate hoisting.

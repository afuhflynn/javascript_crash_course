1. Declare 2 numbers (a, b) and then perform (+, -, *, /, %). 
HINT: % = modulus
2. Explain in your own words what you understand by the Number constructor
3. Declare 4 integers and calculate their sum and average
4. Declare 6 integers and then for each integer log `even number` if it is divisible by 2 else `odd number`
5. In your own words explain what you understand by an integer and a floating point number. And then visually explain the concept 
with code (making use of the Number constructor, typeof, etc.)

## Introduction

> **Before we begin, first lets get ourselves familiar with what JavaScript is all about**

* `JavaScript is a dynamic web (client side / frontend) programming language.`

### A brief history

JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich, a developer at Netscape Communications Corporation, in 1995. Its initial development was very rapid, and much of the criti‚Äêcism leveled at JavaScript has cited the lack of planning foresight during its development. However, Brendan Eich was not a dabbler: he had a solid foundation in computer science, and incorporated remarkably sophisticated and prescient ideas into JavaScript. In many ways, it was ahead of its time, and it took 15 years for main‚Äêstream developers to catch on to the sophistication the language offered.

#### Interesting facts about JavaScript

JavaScript started life with the name Mocha, and was briefly named LiveScript before being officially renamed to JavaScript in a Netscape Navigator release in 1995. The word ‚ÄúJava‚Äù in ‚ÄúJavaScript‚Äù was not coincidental, but it is confusing: aside from a common syntactic ancestry, JavaScript has more in common with Self (a prototype-based language developed at Xerox PARC in the mid-‚Äô80s) and Scheme (a language developed in the 1970s by Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman, which was in turn heavily influenced by Lisp and ALGOL) than with Java. Eich was familiar with both Self and Scheme, and used some of their forward-thinking paradigms in developing JavaScript. The name JavaScript was partially a marketing attempt to tie into the success Java was enjoying at the time.1 In November 1996, Netscape announced that they had submitted JavaScript to Ecma, a private, international nonprofit standards organization that carries significant influence in the technology and communications industries. Ecma International published the first edition of the ECMA-26 specification, which was, in essence, JavaScript.

> *NOTES:* `In recent years JavaScript has gone from just a client side web programming language to powering one of the world's largest code editor (VS Code with the help of TypeScript and Electron Framework) and it has also gained popularity in the domains of mobile development and server side scripting with the help of Node.js.`
